# HogTank BBQ

A static site built with HTML, CSS and Bootsrap, with a FormSubmit contact form.


## Description

This site was built as a concept for a barbeque restaurant for my husband. He has 
always dreamed of having his own, so I thought it would be fun to create the site for
him, while also helping myself improve my developer skills. While building the site
I learned about placing items with Flexbox and had a chance to use Bootstraps carousel,
as well as implementing a simple contact form with FormSubmit.
